DSA Codes in Java
ðŸ‘‹ Hello, fellow learners and coding enthusiasts!

Welcome to my DSA Codes repository, where I've compiled a collection of major Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in Java. ðŸ“š This repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone looking to strengthen their understanding of DSA or seeking practical examples to enhance their coding skills.

About the Repository
As a passionate student, I've dedicated significant time and effort to curating this repository to help others in their DSA journey. The repository is organized into different folders, each focusing on a specific data structure and its associated algorithms. Here's a quick overview of the folders you'll find:

Array: Explore the fundamental operations and algorithms related to arrays, such as searching, sorting, and manipulation techniques.
LinkedList: Dive into the world of linked lists, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. Discover algorithms for insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Stack: Understand the concept of stacks and implement algorithms like push, pop, and peek. Learn about applications such as balanced parentheses and postfix evaluation.
Queue: Explore the various types of queues, such as normal queues, circular queues, and priority queues. Implement operations like enqueue, dequeue, and check for queue emptiness.
Tree: Uncover the beauty of trees, including binary trees, binary search trees, and AVL trees. Implement tree traversals, insertion, deletion, and search algorithms.
Graph: Delve into the realm of graphs and their algorithms. Learn about traversals, shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm, and depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS).
Each folder contains well-documented Java code that you can easily understand and use for learning purposes or as a reference while implementing similar functionality in your projects.

How to Use this Repository
Clone or Download: Clone this repository to your local machine using the git clone command or download it as a ZIP file and extract the contents.

Explore the Folders: Browse through the folders based on the specific data structure or algorithm you're interested in studying. Open the files to examine the code and accompanying explanations.

Compile and Run: Use your preferred Java IDE or command line tools to compile and run the code files. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.

Learn and Adapt: Study the code and grasp the underlying concepts. Try to understand how the algorithms work and how they can be applied to different scenarios. Feel free to adapt and reuse the code in your own projects, giving proper credit to the original source.
